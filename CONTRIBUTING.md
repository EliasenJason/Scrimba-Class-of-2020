Thank you for your consideration in contributing to this project! The purpose of this project is to get practice with collaboration and basic Git commands. The only limitation that I request is that contributing members are Scrimba students. If you are not a Scrimba student, you are welcome to create a copy of the project structure and edit it to meet your needs.

To start the project, I created student cards to fill out. I left detailed instructions in the README file on how to fill them out and edit the code. 

If you do not wish to fill out a student card, please consider other contributions to this project. A few suggestions I have are changing the overall style and structure, adding media queries, creating a search by class, or search by student capability. Please feel free to make any contribution suggestions.

Thanks again, and I look forward to collaborating on this project!
